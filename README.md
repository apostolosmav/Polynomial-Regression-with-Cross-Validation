# Polynomial-Regression-with-Cross-Validation
This project demonstrates polynomial regression on a dataset using K-Fold cross-validation.  It evaluates polynomial models of different degrees, computes their mean squared error (MSE),  and visualizes the results to select the best-fitting polynomial.
